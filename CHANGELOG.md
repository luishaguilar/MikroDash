# Changelog

All notable changes to MikroDash will be documented in this file.

## [0.5.6] — Streaming Architecture, Router CPU Optimisations & Bug Fixes

### Streaming — event-driven collectors (replaces polling)

Four collectors converted from fixed-interval polling to RouterOS `/listen` streams.
Each opens a persistent stream on connect, receives only delta rows when something
changes, and falls back to a full `/print` reload on stream error. A 60-second
heartbeat emit keeps stale-detection timers alive when data is stable.

- **Firewall** (`/ip/firewall/filter/listen`, `/nat/listen`, `/mangle/listen`) —
  three concurrent streams replace the 10-second poll. Rule changes and counter
  updates appear instantly. Eliminates 18 API calls/min at default interval.
- **VPN / WireGuard** (`/interface/wireguard/peers/listen`) — stream fires on
  handshake and byte-counter updates. Eliminates 6 API calls/min.
- **Interface Status** (`/interface/listen`) — stream fires on up/down state
  changes for instant tile colour updates. A lightweight 5-second stats poll
  (scoped to counter fields only) runs in parallel to drive the live rate bars,
  since byte counters are not pushed through the listen stream.
- **ARP** (`/ip/arp/listen`) — stream fires when devices appear, disappear, or
  change MAC binding. Eliminates 2 API calls/min; new devices now appear
  instantly rather than within the previous 30-second poll window.

### Performance — `.proplist` field scoping

RouterOS sends all available fields per row unless told otherwise. Added
`=.proplist=` to every remaining unscoped collector to request only the fields
MikroDash actually reads, reducing per-call payload size:

- **Connection table cache** — 7 fields requested instead of ~15 per entry.
  With large connection tables (hundreds to thousands of entries polled at 3s)
  this is the single largest wire-traffic reduction.
- **Interface Status** — scoped to 10 fields for `/interface/print` and 2 for
  `/ip/address/print`.
- **Top Talkers** — scoped to 4 fields for `/ip/kid-control/device/print`.
- **System** — scoped to 11 fields for `/system/resource/print`.
- **Wireless** — scoped to 12 fields for both registration table APIs
  (`/interface/wifi/registration-table/print` and
  `/interface/wireless/registration-table/print`).

### Performance — additional optimisations

- **Socket.IO `perMessageDeflate`** — WebSocket per-message deflate enabled at
  compression level 1. Repetitive JSON payloads (connection tables, interface
  lists) typically compress 60–80%.
- **Shared connection table cache** — `ConnectionsCollector` and
  `BandwidthCollector` share a single `/ip/firewall/connection/print` fetch
  per cycle. Cache TTL is now **40% of the faster collector's poll interval**
  (previously a fixed 1500ms) so it works correctly at any poll rate including
  1-second bandwidth polling.
- **Traffic collector idle-gating** — `/interface/monitor-traffic` API calls
  are skipped entirely when no browser clients are connected
  (`io.engine.clientsCount === 0`). Eliminates 60 API calls/min when the
  dashboard is unattended.
- **Firewall / VPN / wireless emit fingerprinting** — socket emits suppressed
  when payload content is unchanged between ticks.
- **System collector** — `/system/package/update/print` decoupled from the
  resource/health tick into a separate background call with a 5-minute
  sub-interval. RouterOS must reach its update server to resolve this call;
  previously this blocked CPU/RAM gauges from appearing on first load.
  Update status now emits independently when it resolves.
- **`system:update` static metadata written once** — board name, ROS version,
  CPU count/frequency, and total RAM never change after boot. `sysMeta`
  is now written to the DOM on the first payload only; subsequent ticks update
  only the dynamic fields (gauges, uptime, temperature).
- **`ts` excluded from client-side connection fingerprints** — previously the
  `ts` timestamp caused fingerprint mismatches on every tick regardless of
  whether data changed.
- **`_updateBwStats` page-visibility gated** — bandwidth stat card and chart
  sync only run when the bandwidth page is active.
- **Country list server-side cap** — `conn:update` slices `topCountries` to
  30 entries before emitting.

### Settings page — poll intervals

- **Streamed collectors** (Interfaces, VPN, Firewall, ARP) no longer show
  editable sliders — replaced with a green **"Event-driven"** badge since their
  data delivery is not controlled by a poll interval.
- **Poll interval sliders reordered** — all configurable (polled) collectors
  listed first, event-driven badges grouped below.
- **`pollTalkers`** added as an independent setting for the Top Talkers card.
  Previously it was silently tied to the Connections interval with no way to
  control it separately.

### Bug Fixes

- **Interfaces page traffic counters not updating** — `/interface/listen` fires
  only on structural changes (up/down), not on byte-counter increments. The
  stats poll now fetches counter fields on the configured interval and merges
  them into the stored interface rows, restoring live rate bars.
- **WireGuard card stale on dashboard** — streamed collectors have no regular
  emit cadence when data is unchanged (e.g. idle peers). All three streamed
  collectors (firewall, VPN, ifStatus) now emit a 60-second heartbeat so the
  stale-detection timer never fires while the stream is healthy. Stale
  thresholds for these cards raised to 90s.
- **Bandwidth table blank on every other tick at 1s poll** — fixed cache TTL
  mismatch: the shared connection table cache had a fixed 1500ms TTL, so at
  1s bandwidth polling every second tick returned the same cached rows, making
  all byte deltas zero. TTL is now 40% of the minimum poll interval.
- **"Checking for updates" stuck on dashboard** — `/system/package/update/print`
  was bundled into the first resource/health tick. RouterOS must reach its
  update server to resolve this, blocking CPU/RAM gauges from appearing.
  Update check now runs in the background and never delays the gauge emit.
- **WAN IP slow to appear on page load** — `sendInitialState` emitted
  `lan:overview` without the `wanIp` field. The IP is now included from the
  cached `state.lastWanIp` value so it appears immediately on connect.
- **Top Talkers poll interval uncontrollable** — talkers was constructed with
  `pollMs: _cfg.pollConns` and had no entry in the live poll-update map.
  Changing the Connections slider silently moved both; there was no way to set
  them independently. Now has its own `pollTalkers` setting.

## [0.5.5] — Bandwidth Page, Performance & Reliability

### Added
- **Bandwidth page** — new dedicated page showing live per-connection bandwidth, accessible from the sidebar. Displays all active firewall connections with real-time RX, TX, and Total Mbps, sortable by any column (default: Total descending)
- **Compact WAN traffic chart** — a 120 px inline Chart.js graph sits above the bandwidth table, mirroring the dashboard traffic feed with no extra API calls
- **RX / TX stat card** — a combined card beside the chart shows live WAN receive and transmit rates, split into value and unit spans for stable right-aligned layout
- **ASN / Org column on Bandwidth page** — uses the same `svcBadge()` colour coding as the Connections page (CDN blue, cloud orange, social purple, etc.)
- **Destination column with geo flag** — shows country flag, ISO code, and city; city is suppressed when it duplicates the country code or is a single character
- **Interface column** — resolved server-side via subnet CIDR matching against the live interface list; no RouterOS field read needed
- **Interface dropdown filter** — seeded from all running interfaces via `ifstatus:update`; DOM only rebuilds when the sorted list actually changes, eliminating per-tick flicker
- **Search + dropdown toolbar** — search box expands to fill all available space; interface and protocol dropdowns are pinned to the right
- **`pollBandwidth` and `pageBandwidth` settings** — both fields were previously silently dropped by the settings validator; both are now accepted and applied correctly

### Performance
- **Shared `/ip/firewall/connection/print` cache** — `ConnectionsCollector` and `BandwidthCollector` previously each fetched the full connection table independently every 3 s (~40 API calls/min combined). Both now read from a shared 1.5 s TTL cache in `index.js`, halving RouterOS API load. Cache is invalidated on disconnect
- **Traffic collector idle-gating** — the 1 s `/interface/monitor-traffic` poll is skipped entirely when no browser clients are connected (`io.engine.clientsCount === 0`), eliminating 60 API calls/min when the dashboard is unattended. The interval continues running so data resumes immediately on reconnect
- **`perMessageDeflate` on Socket.IO** — WebSocket per-message deflate enabled (compression level 1) reducing repetitive JSON payload sizes by 60–80% with negligible CPU overhead
- **Fingerprint-gate on `firewall`, `vpn`, and `wireless` emits** — each collector computes a lightweight fingerprint over its structural data before emitting; the socket write is suppressed when nothing has changed. Firewall rules and VPN peers are stable for hours at a time
- **`_resolveIface` result cache** — bandwidth collector caches subnet-to-interface resolution per source IP in a `Map`, cleared on reconnect. Eliminates repeated CIDR iteration for the same stable LAN hosts every tick
- **Server-side country list cap** — `conn:update` now slices `topCountries` to 30 entries before emitting; the client never renders more than this
- **`ts` excluded from client-side fingerprints** — connection source and destination fingerprints previously hashed the full object including `ts`, which changes every tick regardless of data. Fingerprints now hash only the meaningful fields
- **`_updateBwStats` page-visibility gate** — bandwidth RX/TX stat card and chart sync only run when the bandwidth page is active

### Bug Fixes
- **Interfaces page stale** — `InterfaceStatusCollector` was fingerprint-suppressing emits when interface up/down state and IPs were unchanged. Because rates change every tick, the stale timer never reset and the page marked itself stale after ~25 s. The collector now always emits unconditionally
- **Bandwidth table columns shifting on refresh** — added `table-layout:fixed` and a `<colgroup>` with explicit percentage widths for all 8 columns. Cells receive `overflow:hidden; text-overflow:ellipsis` so long content truncates within the fixed width rather than pushing columns
- **`fmtMbps` HTML injection in bandwidth stat card** — a local `fmtMbps` inside the bandwidth IIFE returned a `<span>` string for zero values; the card used `textContent` so the raw HTML rendered as literal text. Local override removed; global plain-text version handles all cases
- **`networksCard` false-stale** — stale grace period widened from 20 s to 45 s (300 s poll × 15%) to accommodate slow RouterOS DHCP responses. The stale timer now also resets on `ping:update` (every 10 s), since the card displays live ping data and should never appear stale while the router is reachable

### UI
- **Page-wide disconnect fade** — when either the Socket.IO connection or the RouterOS connection drops and the reconnecting banner appears, the entire page (`#sidenav` and `#main`) fades to 35% opacity with `pointer-events:none` and a 0.35 s transition, matching the visual language of individual stale cards. Cleared immediately on reconnect

## [0.5.4] — Performance, Settings & DHCP Improvements

### Added
- **Settings page** — new page accessible via a gear icon pinned to the bottom of the sidebar; About moved below Settings
- **Persistent settings store** (`src/settings.js`) — saves to `/data/settings.json` on the Docker volume; merges over `.env` values on boot so existing deployments are unaffected
- **AES-256-GCM credential encryption** — router password and dashboard password are encrypted at rest using a key derived from the `DATA_SECRET` env var
- **`GET /api/settings`** — returns current settings with credentials masked as `••••••••`
- **`POST /api/settings`** — validates and saves settings; applies poll interval changes live without restart; broadcasts page visibility changes to all connected clients; returns `requiresRestart: true` if router connection fields changed
- **Live poll interval sliders** — all collector poll intervals adjustable via range sliders; changes take effect immediately without restart
- **Page visibility toggles** — any page except Dashboard and Settings can be hidden; hidden pages are removed from the sidebar instantly; active page redirects to Dashboard if hidden
- **Router connection settings** — host, port, username, password, TLS toggle, self-signed cert toggle, default WAN interface, ping target
- **Dashboard auth settings** — HTTP Basic Auth username and password configurable from the UI
- **Limits settings** — Top N connections/talkers/firewall rules, max connections, traffic history minutes
- **Reset to defaults** button — restores all settings to compiled-in defaults
- **Docker volume** — `docker-compose.yml` now mounts a named `mikrodash-data` volume at `/data`

### Changed
- **Boot from settings** — `index.js` reads router credentials and all poll intervals from the settings store on startup; `.env` vars still seed the defaults if no `settings.json` exists yet
- **DHCP Networks poll default raised to 5 min (300,000 ms)** — network definitions and WAN IP are static config that rarely change; lease counts are derived from the in-memory store so are unaffected. Slider range updated to 30 s – 10 min; `.env.example` updated to match
- **Merged duplicate socket listeners** — `ifstatus:update`, `vpn:update`, `system:update`, and `ping:update` each previously registered two handlers (render + notification); consolidated into single handlers
- **`system:update` dirty-checking** — gauges, sys-meta, and update row fingerprinted; DOM only rebuilt when values change
- **`ifstatus:update` dirty-checking** — interface grid skips full `innerHTML` rewrite when name/state/rates are unchanged
- **Wireless dirty-checking** — wireless table skips rebuild when MAC/signal/tx-rate/uptime are unchanged
- **`renderCountryList` dirty-checking** — skips rewrite when data and selection are unchanged
- **`renderPortList` dirty-checking** — skips rebuild when data is unchanged
- **Page-visibility gating** — country/port lists, interface grid, wireless table, and firewall table skip all DOM work when the tab is hidden or the relevant page is not active
- **Log count badge debounce** — `updateLogCounts()` debounced to 250 ms during rapid log bursts
- **Map tooltip `getBoundingClientRect()` cached** — rect cached per hover session, invalidated on resize; eliminates a forced layout reflow on every `mousemove`
- **Map pulse animation via `rAF` double-frame** — replaces forced synchronous reflow used to restart CSS animations
- **Per-tick GeoIP dedup** (`connections.js`) — `geoLookup()` called at most once per unique destination IP per tick
- **Wireless MAC name cache** (`wireless.js`) — `getNameByMAC()` result cached between ticks in a `Map`; cleared on reconnect

### Server
- **Event-driven DHCP lease updates** (`dhcpLeases.js`) — removed 15-second periodic `leases:list` broadcast; `_applyLease` now emits an updated lease table immediately on any change from the live stream; `_loadInitial` emits once after startup `/print`
- **Removed `pollMs` from `DhcpLeasesCollector`** — no longer accepts a poll interval; `LEASES_POLL_MS` env var has no effect and can be removed from `.env`
## [0.5.3] — UI & Accuracy Improvements

### Features

- **Per-band wireless client counts** — the Wireless Clients card header now
  shows live counts per band (`2.4GHz: N`, `5GHz: N`, and `6GHz: N` when
  present), separated from the total count badge by a thin vertical divider
  (`public/index.html`, `public/app.js`)
- **ASN / org lookup on Connections page** — destination IPs are resolved to
  organisation names via a curated CIDR→org table with a 5000-entry LRU cache,
  displayed as a label beneath each IP:port entry; no new runtime dependencies
  (`src/util/asnLookup.js`, `src/collectors/connections.js`,
  `public/index.html`, `public/app.js`)
- **Service badge colour coding** — destinations are grouped into seven
  categories (cdn, cloud, social, streaming, messaging, video, dns) with
  distinct coloured inline badges in Top Destinations, org sub-rows in Top
  Countries, and IP tooltips on hover (`public/index.html`, `public/app.js`,
  `src/util/asnLookup.js`, `src/collectors/connections.js`)
- **Connection Flow Sankey diagram** — a pure-SVG source→destination flow
  diagram rendered at the bottom of the Connections page, driven by
  `conn:update` data, with proportional ribbon widths, category colours, and
  resize-awareness; no external library (`public/index.html`, `public/app.js`)
- **Log count indicators** — four clickable severity pill badges (`N errors`,
  `N warnings`, `N info`, `N debug`) in the Logs card header tally the buffer
  by severity, toggle the severity filter on click, and remain visible at zero
  count (`public/index.html`, `public/app.js`)

### Bug Fixes

- **Wireless band detection uses RouterOS registration table directly** —
  the previous heuristic based on interface name patterns and tx-rate strings
  (`MHT-xxx`, `HE-MCS`) incorrectly reported 5GHz for some 2.4GHz clients.
  The collector now reads the `band` field directly from each registration
  table entry — the same authoritative source Winbox displays in its Band
  column (`src/collectors/wireless.js`)
- **Ping target label updates dynamically** — `<span id="pingTargetLabel">`
  is now updated from `data.target` in both `ping:history` and `ping:update`
  handlers (`public/app.js`)
- **Wired client count uses interface type allowlist** — count now derives
  from `type === 'ether'` entries in `ifstatus:update` rather than the talkers
  list, avoiding false positives (`public/app.js`)

### UI

- **Connections page layout reorganised** — Top Countries now spans the full
  page width; Connection Flow and Top Ports share the row below it at a
  `2fr 1fr` split (`public/index.html`)
- **Sankey diagram taller** — minimum height raised from 180px to 260px and
  per-source row height increased from 24px to 36px (`public/app.js`)
- **Service badge colours fully distinct** — `svc-video` changed from blue
  (conflicting with `svc-cdn`) to amber; `svc-dns` changed from green
  (conflicting with `svc-messaging`) to teal; Sankey ribbon colours updated
  to match (`public/index.html`, `public/app.js`)
- **Log count badges more visible** — background and text opacities raised
  across all four severity levels; debug badge no longer uses the near-invisible
  `--text-muted` colour (`public/index.html`)
- **Country list sparklines moved to top-right** — the per-country sparkline
  is repositioned to the top-right of the country name row using a flex
  space-between wrapper (`public/app.js`)
- **Nav logo no longer jumps on expand/collapse** — logo previously switched
  between `justify-content:center` and `flex-start` mid-transition; it now
  sits permanently left-aligned with `padding:0 14px`, matching the nav icons,
  with no animated properties (`public/index.html`)
- **Traffic card width on mobile fixed** — removed a redundant inner wrapper
  div that caused the Traffic card to render slightly narrower than sibling
  cards on mobile viewports (`public/index.html`)
- **Mobile topbar decluttered** — clock and router tag spans hidden at ≤767px
  via `.topbar-mobile-hide` (`public/index.html`)
- **Mobile dashboard scaling** — `.page-view` padding reduced on small screens;
  grid gaps tightened; connections card set to `height:auto` on narrow
  viewports; `connMapList` grid uses `minmax(min(220px,100%),1fr)` to prevent
  horizontal overflow (`public/index.html`)

## [0.5.2] — UI Improvements & Bug Fixes

### Features

- **Live interface traffic rates on Interfaces page** — each interface tile now
  displays real-time RX and TX rates with colour-coded bar indicators (blue for
  RX, green for TX) that scale relative to the session peak. Rates are derived
  from cumulative byte counter deltas between polls, since
  `rx-bits-per-second` is not available from `/interface/print`
  (`src/collectors/interfaceStatus.js`, `public/index.html`, `public/app.js`)
- **Log persistence across page refreshes** — the server now maintains a
  ring buffer of the last 500 log entries (configurable via `LOG_HISTORY_SIZE`)
  and replays them to each new socket connection, so the Logs page is no longer
  blank after a refresh (`src/collectors/logs.js`, `src/index.js`,
  `public/app.js`)
- **Self-hosted fonts** — JetBrains Mono and Syne are now bundled as woff2
  files under `public/vendor/fonts/`, eliminating the last remaining external
  requests to Google Fonts and completing the fully air-gapped deployment story
  (`public/vendor/fonts/`, `public/index.html`)

### UI

- **Item count badges on Interfaces and VPN pages** — the Interfaces card and
  the WireGuard Peers card now show a count badge matching the style used on
  Wireless Clients and DHCP (`public/index.html`, `public/app.js`)
- **Consistent card badge styling across all pages** — all five card badges
  (Wireless Clients, DHCP, WireGuard dashboard, WireGuard Peers, Interfaces)
  now use a shared `.card-badge` CSS class with CSS variable-based colours that
  are legible in both dark and light mode, replacing the Tabler `bg-*` classes
  that were invisible in light mode (`public/index.html`, `public/app.js`)

### Bug Fixes

- **Notification bell invisible in light mode** — the bell SVG had an inline
  `stroke:var(--text-muted)` overriding `currentColor`, a blanket `opacity:.85`
  on the button, and no explicit `width`/`height` on dynamically injected SVGs,
  causing it to be nearly invisible or zero-sized. All three issues resolved
  (`public/index.html`, `public/app.js`)
- **ROS and reconnect banners stacking** — when the router disconnected,
  both the amber RouterOS banner and the red Socket.IO reconnect banner could
  appear simultaneously. The reconnect banner now suppresses the ROS banner
  while active, and restores it on reconnect only if the router is still
  offline (`public/app.js`)
- **VPN peer dot hidden on long peer names** — the status dot in WireGuard
  peer tiles was clipped when the peer name was long due to `overflow:hidden`
  applied to the flex container. The dot is now `flex-shrink:0` and truncation
  applies only to the name text span (`public/index.html`, `public/app.js`)

## [0.5.1] — Production Resilience Hardening

### Security

- **Self-hosted frontend assets and tightened CSP** — the dashboard now serves
  vendored Chart.js, TopoJSON, world-atlas, and Tabler assets locally instead
  of loading them from third-party CDNs. Helmet configuration was extracted
  into a dedicated module and tightened to a self-hosted Content Security
  Policy (`src/security/helmetOptions.js`, `public/index.html`, `public/app.js`,
  `public/vendor/`)
- **Startup patch verification for `node-routeros`** — application startup now
  hard-fails if the required MikroDash compatibility markers are missing from
  the patched `node-routeros` files, preventing silent boot with a broken
  runtime (`src/index.js`)
- **Socket.IO connection cap** — the server now applies a configurable
  `MAX_SOCKETS` limit and caps Socket.IO message size, reducing abuse surface
  on LAN deployments (`src/index.js`)

### Reliability

- **Per-command RouterOS write timeout with forced reconnect** — one-shot
  RouterOS API calls now use a configurable timeout budget
  (`ROS_WRITE_TIMEOUT_MS`) and close the active shared connection on timeout so
  the existing reconnect loop can recover cleanly (`src/routeros/client.js`)
- **Inflight guards across polling collectors** — all interval-based
  collectors now skip overlapping runs instead of stacking concurrent RouterOS
  calls when a slow tick exceeds its poll interval (`src/collectors/*.js`)
- **Graceful shutdown with unref’d fallback timer** — shutdown now stops
  RouterOS, Socket.IO, and HTTP resources in order and uses an unref’d 5-second
  forced-exit timer so the fallback does not keep the process alive on its own
  (`src/index.js`, `src/shutdown.js`)
- **RouterOS patch verification and write-timeout helpers extracted for testable
  runtime behavior** — health/CSP/shutdown support code was split into small
  modules to make the hardening logic independently testable
  (`src/health.js`, `src/security/helmetOptions.js`, `src/shutdown.js`)

### Operations

- **`/healthz` now behaves like readiness** — the endpoint returns `503` until
  startup completes or when RouterOS is disconnected, and now includes a
  `startupReady` flag in the JSON body (`src/index.js`, `src/health.js`)
- **Connection-table processing cap metadata** — the connections collector now
  reports the raw total separately from the number of rows processed, exposing
  `processed` and `processingCapped` to make truncation explicit (`src/collectors/connections.js`)
- **Auth failure tracking cap** — the in-memory auth failure map now evicts the
  oldest tracked IPs once it exceeds `maxTrackedIPs`, bounding memory growth
  under probe traffic (`src/auth/basicAuth.js`)
- **Wireless API probe debug logging** — failed wireless capability probes now
  log at debug level instead of failing silently (`src/collectors/wireless.js`)

### Bug Fixes

- **Info-page logo path normalized** — the about/info page now uses `/logo.png`
  like the rest of the app, avoiding broken image resolution on non-root paths
  (`public/index.html`)
- **Removed stale vendored CSS sourcemap reference** — the checked-in Tabler CSS
  no longer advertises a missing `.map` file, eliminating pointless 404s in
  browser devtools (`public/vendor/tabler.min.css`)
- **`package.json` version now matches app version** — `package.json` was
  still reporting `0.4.8` while `app.js`, the changelog, and `/healthz` all
  reported `0.5.0`; version bumped to `0.5.1` to resolve the mismatch
  (`package.json`)
- **`.log-line` CSS rule added** — `buildLogHtml()` wraps each entry in
  `<div class="log-line">` but no matching rule existed; added `.log-line`
  with `display:block`, `padding`, and a subtle hover highlight
  (`public/index.html`)
- **Log colours now visible in light mode** — `.log-error`, `.log-warning`,
  `.log-debug`, `.log-info` and all topic classes (`.log-dhcp`,
  `.log-wireless`, `.log-firewall`, `.log-system`) had no
  `html[data-theme="light"]` overrides, making several severity levels
  nearly invisible on a light background; 12 light-mode rules added
  (`public/index.html`)

### Features

- **RouterOS offline banner** — a yellow warning banner now appears at the
  top of the dashboard whenever RouterOS is not reachable, with a plain-
  English reason (e.g. "Connection refused — is RouterOS reachable at
  192.168.88.1?"). The banner dismisses automatically when the connection
  is restored. Distinct from the red Socket.IO reconnect banner which fires
  only when the browser loses its connection to the MikroDash server itself
  (`public/index.html`, `public/app.js`, `src/index.js`)
- **Container no longer blocks on RouterOS availability** — the startup
  sequence previously called `waitUntilConnected(60000)` in an async IIFE,
  meaning the HTTP server started but collectors never ran if RouterOS was
  unreachable at boot. The startup is now event-driven: collectors start the
  moment the `connected` event fires (whether that is immediately or minutes
  later), and the container stays healthy the entire time. The `ros:status`
  event is broadcast to all connected browser clients on every connection
  state change so the UI always reflects reality (`src/index.js`)
- **Human-readable RouterOS error messages** — raw Node.js network errors
  (`ECONNREFUSED`, `ETIMEDOUT`, `ENOTFOUND`, `ECONNRESET`) and RouterOS
  errors (TLS certificate, authentication) are translated to clear
  actionable messages before being sent to the client (`src/index.js`)

### Tests

- **Added production resilience regression coverage** — new tests cover the
  self-hosted asset/CSP contract, readiness health semantics, forced shutdown
  timer unref behavior, RouterOS write timeout recovery, connection collector
  truncation metadata, and auth failure eviction (`test/production-resilience-regressions.test.js`,
  `test/smoke-fixes.test.js`)

## [0.5.0] — UI Fixes & Security Hardening

### Security

- **Closed `traffic:select` whitelist race** — `_normalizeIfName()` in
  `TrafficCollector` previously allowed `traffic:select` events through when
  `availableIfs` was empty (i.e. before `sendInitialState()` had completed),
  bypassing the interface whitelist entirely. The guard is now inverted: an
  empty whitelist is treated as "not ready" and the event is rejected with a
  console warning rather than passed to the RouterOS API
  (`src/collectors/traffic.js`)

### Bug Fixes

- **Log viewer entries now render on separate lines** — `buildLogHtml()`
  was returning bare `<span>` elements joined with `\n`. Inside a `<div>`
  container, `\n` is collapsed whitespace and produces no visual line break.
  Each entry is now wrapped in a `<div class="log-line">` block element so
  every router log entry occupies its own line. The `flushLogs()` join
  separator is also cleaned up from `'\n'` to `''`
  (`public/app.js`)
- **Notification bell icon now shown on page load** — `updateNotifBtn()` was
  only ever called after an async `Notification.requestPermission()` callback,
  leaving the hardcoded crossed-bell SVG from `index.html` in place for the
  entire session on browsers where permission had already been granted. A
  startup IIFE now reads `Notification.permission` synchronously and calls
  `updateNotifBtn()` immediately so the correct icon is rendered before the
  user sees the topbar (`public/app.js`)
- **SVG network diagram boxes now respect light mode** — `.nd-node`,
  `.nd-count`, `.nd-label`, `.nd-wan-ip`, `.nd-line`, and `.nd-router-bg`
  had hardcoded dark RGBA fill/stroke values with no light-mode override,
  causing the Wired, Wireless, and WAN boxes to remain dark when switching
  themes. Seven `html[data-theme="light"]` CSS rules now override all
  affected SVG classes with light-appropriate colours (`public/index.html`)

### Features

- **`interfaces:error` Socket.IO event** — when `fetchInterfaces()` fails
  during `sendInitialState()`, the server now emits `interfaces:error` with
  the reason string instead of silently resolving to an empty list via
  `Promise.allSettled()`. The client handles this event by showing an
  explicit "Interface list unavailable" placeholder in the interface dropdown
  and logging the reason to the browser console, replacing a silent empty
  dropdown with actionable feedback (`src/index.js`, `public/app.js`)

## [0.4.9] — Deep Code Review Hardening Pass

### Security

- **HMAC-based timing-safe credential comparison** — authentication now
  compares HMAC-SHA256 digests of fixed length via `crypto.timingSafeEqual`,
  eliminating the timing side-channel that leaked credential length through
  the old length-check fast path (`446f2d2`)
- **Dropped unconditional X-Forwarded-For trust** — `getClientIp()` no longer
  reads `X-Forwarded-For` by default, preventing attackers from spoofing their
  IP to bypass rate limiting (`446f2d2`)
- **Sanitized /healthz error strings** — error messages are now truncated to
  200 characters with stack traces stripped before being exposed in the health
  endpoint, preventing internal implementation details from leaking (`faba151`)

### Features

- **Opt-in `TRUSTED_PROXY` env var** — when set to a proxy IP (e.g.
  `127.0.0.1`), Express `trust proxy` is enabled and `req.ip` correctly
  resolves the real client address from `X-Forwarded-For`. Disabled by default
  for safe out-of-the-box behaviour (`8965a31`)
- **Incremental ping updates** — server now emits lightweight `ping:update`
  events with only the latest data point; full history is sent once via
  `ping:history` on client connect, reducing per-tick payload size (`acb8001`)

### Bug Fixes

- **Unified version strings** — `APP_VERSION` is now sourced from
  `package.json` in one place, fixing inconsistencies between the healthz
  endpoint and startup log messages (`157986e`)
- **Removed redundant dynamic require** — `geoip-lite` was being required
  twice (module-level and inside a function); consolidated to module-level
  only (`157986e`)
- **Fixed /api/localcc polling storm** — client-side code moved the
  `fetch('/api/localcc')` call from inside the `conn:update` handler (fired
  every 3 s) to a once-per-connect pattern (`4b9e862`)
- **Decoupled wanIface from process.env** — `DhcpNetworksCollector` now
  receives `wanIface` as a constructor parameter instead of reading
  `process.env.WAN_IFACE` directly, improving testability (`4b9e862`)
- **Pruned stale keys in firewall, VPN, and talkers prev-maps** — all three
  Maps grew unboundedly as rules/peers/devices were added and removed; each
  collector now tracks seen keys per tick and deletes stale entries
  (`010bb46`)
- **Error state consistency** — all 7 collectors now set `lastXxxErr = null`
  on success instead of `delete`, keeping the state object shape stable and
  matching the initial values in `index.js` (`6df3e92`)
- **Per-interface traffic error flag** — replaced the single boolean
  `_hadTrafficErr` with a per-interface `Set`, so an error on one interface
  no longer suppresses first-error logging on others (`6df3e92`)
- **Extracted PING_COUNT constant** — the magic number `3` used in both the
  RouterOS ping command and the loss-calculation fallback is now a named
  constant (`6df3e92`)
- **DOM-based log truncation** — replaced `innerHTML.split('\n')` with
  `childNodes` counting and `removeChild`, avoiding O(n) re-serialization
  of the log panel on every new log line (`faba151`)

### Performance

- **Single-pass connections loop** — merged three separate iterations over
  the connections array (src/dst counts, protocol counts, country/port counts)
  into one loop (`acb8001`)
- **ARP reverse index** — `arp.js` now maintains a `byMAC` Map updated
  atomically in `tick()`, making `getByMAC()` O(1) instead of O(n)
  (`acb8001`)

### Earlier Hardening (prior commits)

- Hardened dashboard runtime paths and general polish (`200c1d9`, `8ac0703`,
  `5009ac9`)
